"Title:
Infrastructure Anomaly Explanation Agent
Problem Statement:
IT infrastructure monitoring tools detect anomalies but often provide cryptic alerts without
explanations. Understanding root causes is essential for timely remediation but requires expert
knowledge. A generative AI agent can analyze alert data and infrastructure logs to generate natural
language explanations and actionable recommendations, reducing mean time to resolution.
Data Requirements:
Simulated or anonymized infrastructure monitoring alerts, system logs, event correlation data, and
remediation playbooks. Data must be representative of common infrastructure issues and
structured for analysis.
(Feel free to generate synthetic data as well from the provided access)
Expected Output:
An AI tool that outputs textual anomaly explanations and suggested remediation actions formatted
in HTML or markdown. Include links to relevant documentation or runbooks. Deliverables contain
source code, example alert datasets, and sample generated reports.
Be creative to go beyond as you solve the above needs"

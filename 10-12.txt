Create a multi-agent system in Python that resolves SonarQube issues automatically:

Agents:
- ScannerAgent: Reads sonar-report.json
- AnalysisAgent: Classifies issues by rule
- FixAgent: Generates corrected code patches
- ReviewAgent: Verifies logic integrity
- AuditAgent: Logs all fixes

Features:
- JSON message protocol (sender, receiver, task, payload)
- Orchestrator to manage communication
- Patch generator that outputs unified diffs
- Do not modify business logic
- Follow Sonar rules exactly

Now generate the full project structure and code.
